           <p>My primary strength is in story design and writing. Working as a writer and the Youth Artistic Director of Proud Theater in Madison for three years, I helped produce four new scripts each week to be incorporated into our shows. These stories were based off of our experiences identities as LGBT youth. My secondary strength is in art, but is also very much connected to my design and writing process. This past summer, I served as Cartoon Network's Comedy Animation Development intern. It was my job to look over storyboards, animatics, and scripts, and look at what wasn't working both artistically and narratively. Over the course of the summer, I developed my own original animated TV series and pitched it to the executives at the studio.

           <p>My majors are Computer Science and Film. I learned to code in C and Python through the computer courses I’ve taken at Wesleyan. 

Film and Game are two different medias, but there are also similarities among them. One thing is that most of them are trying to tell a story for the audience. Having shot several individual film projects, I know how to apply the storytelling techniques I learned from theory-based film classes in real films. Many of the techniques work in the same way in game according to my own experience as a gamer. 

Finally, I’m somewhat familiar with the business mechanism of film industry. I’ve taken a symposium class during my film summer program in UCLA and learned a lot from the professionals working in the industry.

           <p>My primary strength, is a deep theoretical understanding of the kinds of minds, narratives, and social realities that emerge alongside digital tools. Using the frame of STS research (science, technology, and society) to grapple with psychology and anthropology, my work has involved analyzing the influence of casino slot machines on location-based advertising to create addictive behavior, the relationships between digital research tools and memory, and the narratives implicit in SimCity, among others.  This background helps me in developing UX (particularly game mechanics and interface design) for any project that my team takes on. I have also worked on sound design and scoring for award-winning animated short films, and have taken the reins of the sound end of my team’s projects.

My primary strength is coding.  I am a computer science major and am currently taking Algorithms and Complexity here at Wesleyan.  I am experienced in programming in C, ML, and Java, and I also have experience with web development languages HTML, CSS and Javascript.  Past projects that I have worked on include a web game designed address apathy towards politics, and I am currently working with three other students on a mobile web application that addresses food waste and hunger by connecting users with leftovers to nearby users in need of food. 

My secondary strength is Art/Design.  I’ve always been drawn towards artistic hobbies, from drawing and painting to videography and playing the cello. My experience with graphic design started senior year in highschool when I designed the front end UI for a webgame ‘Primary Panic’ which was essentially a March Madness bracket for the presidential election.

           <p>I’ve been interested in the arts my entire life. Ceramics and sculpture are my strengths, however I also draw, paint, and have some experience in photoshop. I have run two Etsy businesses selling my art and curated vintage goods. My sister and I designed the business cards and logos, and reached out to other businesses to sell not only online but in person. We did pop-ups at various retail stores such as Urban Outfitters in Harvard Square and Loyal Supply Co., a design shop in Union Square, as well as sell at local craft markets.

I am a first year student here at Wesleyan with a tentative major in Computer Science. My only experience in programming has been here as a freshman. I have a proficient understanding in Python and created a playable, simple game as a project.
